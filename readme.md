# Command Design Pattern
> Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize other objects with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

-  Living Room Turn Light on and off
-  Kitchen Room Turn light on and off
-  Ceiling Fan High and low
